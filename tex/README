Document class and styles can be installed with ctanify.  For instance, to
install foo.cls in the personal directory tree, one can do

ctanify --pkgname=foo -d `kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME` -- foo.cls

The pkgname option is not necessary when installing .sty files.

Use TEXMFLOCAL instead of TEXMFHOME to install in /usr/local.  Installing
system-wide requires running texhash afterwards.
